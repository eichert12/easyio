= easyio

A simple library for making working with CSV files slightly easier by wrapping up default options and providing a few simple helper methods.

Note: Version 0.3 and above require Ruby 1.9+, for 1.8 compatibility use Version 0.2

== Note on Patches/Pull Requests
 
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but
   bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
